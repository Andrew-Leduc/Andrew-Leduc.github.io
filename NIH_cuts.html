        Basic Scientific Research: How It Works and Why It Matters
      </h1>

      <p>
        I decided to write this in light of recent government policies that
        threaten to devastate the world’s premier ecosystem for scientific
        research. These include the reduction in overhead costs to 15% on NIH
        grants, the firing of thousands of employees from the NIH and NHS, and
        the anticipated 50% reduction in the NSF budget. Many people don’t know
        how fundamental science is conducted, funded, or why it matters—if that
        sounds like you, please read on. (I discuss the specifics of overhead
        costs, why they matter, and why 15% is dangerously low at the end.)
      </p>

      <h2>What Is Basic Science?</h2>
      <p>
        Science is a method for investigating how the natural world works. It
        involves making measurements, comparing them to our current
        understanding, refining that understanding, and then repeating this
        cycle. We generally call research
        <em>basic science</em>
        if it does not have an immediate, obvious path to economic return—so it
        doesn’t attract private investment in the short term (roughly 5–10
        years). Instead, governments primarily fund basic science using taxpayer
        dollars (plus a small percentage from charities, often incentivized by
        tax breaks).
      </p>

      <h2>Why Public Funding Matters</h2>
      <p>
        You might think: “If it’s not expected to have a direct real-world impact
        soon, why should I pay for it?” or “Why does the NIH need a \$46 billion
        budget? Why fund quantum gravity if the deficit is over \$36 trillion?”
        These are legitimate concerns. Yet, funding for basic science through
        the NIH and NSF is only about
        <strong>1.1% of yearly tax revenue</strong> (or
        <strong>0.77% of government spending</strong> in 2024).
      </p>
      <p>
        This investment is crucial because
        <strong>basic science is the economic engine</strong> powering many
        breakthroughs. The internet, ChatGPT, antibiotics, and cancer
        treatments—all of these exist thanks to basic research, much of it done
        at universities. Consider mRNA vaccine technology: it arose from 20 years
        of lab studies starting in the 1990s. Likewise, modern AI relies on
        decades of work on neural networks and non-convex optimization—
        <em>published</em> by university researchers, not by the CEOs currently
        commercializing it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our university research system is one of the United States’ greatest
        strengths. It attracts talented scientists from around the world, many
        of whom stay here (when allowed by immigration policy). By training new
        scientists and spinning out cutting-edge ideas, our universities help
        create the most innovative industries in the world.
      </p>

      <h2>Concern About “Waste” and Overhead Costs</h2>
      <p>
        Perhaps you worry about potential waste of taxpayer dollars. That brings
        us to
        <strong>overhead costs</strong>, which have been slashed from about 35%
        on NIH grants to 15% under new policies. Typically, if a professor is
        awarded \$1 million from the NIH, the university receives an additional
        ~35% in “indirect costs” to pay for essential infrastructure: buildings,
        electricity, lab equipment, administrative staff, etc. While “indirect
        costs” can seem opaque, they’re critical for enabling research—
        especially in high-cost urban areas like Boston, New York, or
        San Francisco.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cutting overhead to 15% drastically reduces a university’s ability to
        maintain these facilities. This move will disproportionately harm top
        institutions that are integral to breakthroughs in cancer research, drug
        discovery, and more. Even if such cuts last only a few years, they could
        delay vital treatments or discoveries—potentially impacting the health
        of countless people.
      </p>

      <h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
      <p>
        Yes, the country faces serious financial constraints, and it’s worth
        reviewing how we allocate our resources. But there’s a difference between
        <strong>responsible oversight</strong> of research funding and an
        <strong>overnight slash</strong> to indirect costs after little
        deliberation. These changes and other cuts are already forcing hiring
        freezes, shutting down labs, and halting progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if you support the current administration, please recognize the
        damage of hasty, extreme cuts to basic science. This research ecosystem
        underpins not just our higher education system, but also the industries
        and treatments that keep us ahead in global innovation. Four years of
        stalled progress could mean someone doesn’t get the therapy they need in
        time.
      </p>

      <p><em>Thank you for reading.</em> If you have questions or want to learn
        more, consider talking to scientists in your community, looking up how
        NIH or NSF grants are allocated, and contacting your representatives.
        Ultimately, basic science is an investment in future breakthroughs that
        can profoundly benefit our society and economy.</p>
