<p style="text-align:center";><a href="https://web.northeastern.edu/slavov/2014_HIquant/">Protocol</a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="for_proto.jpg" width="800" height="300" alt="The Scream">

<p style="text-align:left;">nPOP is a droplet based method that for single cell proteomic sample preperation.
  We see nPOP as a conceptual framework moreso than a specific workflow. In this post I will talk about why we
  designed nPOP, how we recommend its use, how to addapt nPOP for different workflows,
  and adress aspects that have not been fully optomized and hopefully may be further explored by others.
  nPOP was developed with several goals in mind.  </p>

<ul class="a">
  <li>1) Miniaturize sample preperation volumes to several nanoliters. This has an number of benefits.
    It enables cleaner samples by reducing the amout of reagents needed to prepare a single cell. It also
    enables higher sample preperation throughput by allowing users to prepare a larger number of samples with less
    reagents. Lastly, it can reduce sample preperation losses by exposing samples to less surface area.  </li>
  <li>2) Fully automate the sample preperation. This can remove batch effects related to user error,
      increasing data consistency while also allowing for increased throughput by removing manual pipetting steps.</li>
  <li>3) Create a flexible workflow that allow users to maximize the number of samples simultaneously prepared and
      can accomidate many different experimental designs. </li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align:left;"> To achieve these goals, we took a unique approach to sample preperation,
abandoning familiar staples of mass spectrometry sample preperation such as tube and wells. In our approach,
single cells are prepared in nanoliter droplets on the surface of an unpatterned glass slide with a flourocarbon
coating. In these droplets, we lyse cells, digest proteins to peptides, label peptides for mutiplexing, and pool
samples into a set. The samples are dispensed into a 384 well plate where they can be picked up by most standard
autosamplers. We use the Ultimate 3000 from Thermo. To perform the sample preperation, we use the CellenONE liquid handling and cell dispensing
  platform made by Scienion. The system uses acoustic technology to reliably dispens cells and various reagents in droplets of ~300
  picoliters. </p>

<p style="text-align:left;"> We have designed the following workflows for mutiplexing with TMT, mTRAQ, and label free.
  We are strong advocates of using multiplxed workflows over labe free methods. The reasons for this are two fold; 1)
  mutiplexing samples provides the opportunity to significantly increase throughput which is essential for many single
  cell applications and 2) labeled methods allow for transfering identifications for peptides that are plenty abundant
  for reliable quantitation, but insufficiently abundant for confident identification. You can read more about both
  DDA and DIA based approches for these strategies in the links below:   </p>
